The 3D Wiggle Player plugin displays any JPG or PNG stereo-gram (3D side-by-side image) as wiggle stereoscopy.

== Description ==

With the 3D Wiggle Player plugin you can display 3D images on your web site that can be watched without glasses. Imagine the impact on your visitors!

= Easy =

Simply add any stereo-gram from your media library, select the image and click on the button labeled "3D" in your content editor to set up the wiggling. Set all animation parameters individually for each image.

= Best Quality =

The plugin generates a transition effect between the images resulting in an unprecedented smooth result.
The image must be adjusted prior to upload. For easy adjustment, you can use our [3DWiggle desktop application](http://www.3dwiggle.com) or any other image editing software.

= Small images =

Heavy GIFs are not needed anymore. The plugin achieves a better result out of a lightweight JPEG image.

= Animation speed and effect settings =

The speed of wiggling, the effect pauses and balance can be set individually for each image.

= Automatic settings extraction =

For images created with the [3DWiggle desktop application](http://www.3dwiggle.com), the plugin automatically extracts animation speed and all effect settings from the JPEG header.

= Support =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What's wiggle stereoscopy? =

For more details [read the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiggle_stereoscopy) on wiggle stereoscopy.

= Where can I find examples of wiggle stereoscopy? =

For examples of wiggle stereoscopy, see [our example gallery](http://www.3dwiggle.com/3d-images-examples/)

= My images are "jumping" around! =

You are using an normal image. You need a side-by-side image, that means one JPEG image with one image on the left and one on the right, also called stereo-gram.

= Do I need the 3DWiggle desktop application? =

No! You don't need to buy our application.
You can use any side-by-side image. You can adjust those images with any image editing software.

However, we created 3DWiggle to allow to:

1. Take 3D images with a normal camera, without tripod or other special equipment
1. Adjust easily the image and the wiggle effect, resulting in an unprecedented wiggling quality

You can try our desktop application for free. For more information visit [3dwiggle.com](http://www.3dwiggle.com/).
